# EDA-OpenAvenues

In continuation of my first repository of the Pandas tutorial, here
I will apply those skills and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset [here](https://github.com/Dameme1/EDA-OpenAvenues/blob/main/Tameem_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb). 

#### Dataset
The data set in this analysis is of doctors that include their names, NPI's, medical school, and much more information that I will dive into.
